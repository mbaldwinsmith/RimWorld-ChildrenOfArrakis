# RimWorld-ChildrenOfArrakis
A Dune-inspired RimWorld overhaul adding an Arrakis desert biome, Fremen factions, extreme water-scarcity survival, stillsuits, windtraps, and deadly sandworms triggered by vibration. Manage hydration, avoid worm attacks, harvest spice blooms, and build sietches to survive the deep desert.
